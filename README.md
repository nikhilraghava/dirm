# Installation & Usage

First, install dirm using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g dirm
```

### Create files

```bash
$ dirm create hello.txt

      _   _
   __| | (_)  _ __   _ __ ___

 | (_| | | | | |    | | | | | |
  \__,_| |_| |_|    |_| |_| |_|

hello.txt has been created successfully
```
Note that the file can be of any file type. If you want to add some content to the file, you can do the following,

```bash
$ dirm create hello.txt "This is a text file"

      _   _
   __| | (_)  _ __   _ __ ___
  / _` | | | | '__| | '_ ` _ \
